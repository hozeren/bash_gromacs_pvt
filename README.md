# csh_gromacs
Bash shell scripts for GROMACS to run multiple simulations and their analysis at once.


MultiGRO consists of two seperated components;

1. **21 step equilibration:** It is well known 21 step decompression equilibration method.
2. **PVT Curves for _T_<sub>g</sub> values:** A method to create PVT curves for glass transition temperature (_T_<sub>g</sub>).

## Usage
### PVT Curves
Pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) curves are used to determine glass transition temperature (_Tg_) of materials.
